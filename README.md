###  About Me

I'm not just a **Data Engineer**, I’m a **data storyteller** who engineers meaning out of chaos.  
I craft cloud-native pipelines that hum at scale, automate workflows like clockwork, and transform data into strategic gold.  

 Currently polishing my skills as a **Master’s student at UNC Charlotte** (May 2025).  
 I speak fluent **Python**, dream in **Spark**, and deploy on **AWS, Azure, and GCP**.  
 My goal? Help organizations turn petabytes into possibilities.

-  **Modular ETL architectures** (ADF + Databricks + Terraform)
-  **BI-friendly lakes and warehouses** (Redshift, Synapse, BigQuery)
-  **ML-integrated data flows** (LLMs, MLlib, Hugging Face)
