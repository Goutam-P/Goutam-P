### 🌟 About Me

I'm not just a **Data Engineer**, I’m a **data storyteller** who engineers meaning out of chaos.  
I craft cloud-native pipelines that hum at scale, automate workflows like clockwork, and transform data into strategic gold.  

🎓 Currently polishing my skills as a **Master’s student at UNC Charlotte** (May 2025).  
🌐 I speak fluent **Python**, dream in **Spark**, and deploy on **AWS, Azure, and GCP**.  
🎯 My goal? Help organizations turn petabytes into possibilities.
